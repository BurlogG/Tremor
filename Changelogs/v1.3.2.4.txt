Changelogs for v1.3.2.4:

Thanks to Eldrazi for many contributions for this patch.

- Items that grant movement speed now also increase the player's maximum run speed by that amount, this ensures the movement speed bonus actually has effect when at capped speed
- Improved certain items' tooltips
- Fixed all tooltips still saying 'alchemic' changed to say 'alchemical'
- Improved and buffed Phantablast
- Fixed many town NPCs not being able to receive their last 2 possible names
- Fixed certain town NPCs their shops
- Fixed certain town NPCs 'can spawns', some may not have been able to spawn before when they should
- Merged certain ModPlayer files, this possibly improves mod load speed
- Many code was shortened, possibly reducing the mod size
- Removed certain drop code for items that don't exist in the mod
- Removed many npc expert scaling that did not actually scale anything. Please leave a suggestion when you find an appropiate scaling for an npc
- Improved certain npc framing to update based on velocity
- Added new features for 'weighted' strings, implemented for town NPCs. This means you will see certain names and chats appear more often than others
- Fixed detached clampers (from the Motherboard fight) having incorrect life values
