Changelogs for v1.3.2.4:

- Items that grant movement speed now also increase the player's maximum run speed by that amount, this ensures the movement speed bonus actually has effect.
- Improved several tooltips, notibly Desert Explorer Greaves said it granted 11% alchemical damage, but it actually granted 16%
- Fixed all tooltips still saying 'alchemic', now changed to say 'alchemical'
