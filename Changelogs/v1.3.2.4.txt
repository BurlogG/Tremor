Changelogs for v1.3.2.4:

Thanks to Eldrazi for many contributions for this patch.

- Items that grant movement speed now also increase the player's maximum run speed by that amount, this ensures the movement speed bonus actually has effect when at capped speed
- Improved certain items' tooltips
- Fixed all tooltips still saying 'alchemic' changed to say 'alchemical'
- Improved and buffed Phantablast
- Fixed many town NPCs not being able to receive their last 2 possible names
- Fixed certain town NPCs their shops
- Fixed certain town NPCs 'can spawns', some may not have been able to spawn before when they should
- Merged certain ModPlayer files, this possibly improves mod load speed
- Many code was shortened, possibly reducing the mod size
- Removed certain drop code for items that don't exist in the mod
- Removed many npc expert scaling that did not actually scale anything. Please leave a suggestion when you find an appropiate scaling for an npc
- Improved certain npc framing to update based on velocity
- You will now see certain names and chats appear more often than others for town NPCs
- Fixed detached clampers (from the Motherboard fight) having incorrect life values
- Implemented actual crit chance and knockback for alchemical weapons. Increases to alchemical crit is no longer just visual in the tooltip but actually takes effect (Knockback for alchemical weapons is implemented, but no items give it yet, leave your suggestions)
- Improved certain tooltips for alchemist class related items (please note I still probably missed many)
- Fixed certain alchemist class items not granting the right amount of increased damage or critical strike chance
- Glacier ice wall can now only spread to other ice or snow
- All treasure bag tooltips 'right click to open' will now translate properly
