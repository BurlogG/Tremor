Changelogs for v1.3.2.5:

Note:
- Update to Fargo's Mod version v13.0 to fix the shop from breaking

Bosses:
- Fixed Paradox Titan (Titan Soul) and Wall of Shadows not registering as kill
- Fixed bosses being seen as defeated for new worlds

Worldgen:
- Removed many (read: at least a dozen) redundant loops iterating world chests (should speed up WorldGen)
- Removed code trying to find a recently placed chest with random coords, with no purpose. (should speed up WorldGen)
- Note: entirety of WorldGen still needs a proper look at. But after some small fixes, I am no longer surprised Tremor breaks WorldGen.

WorldGen Chests:
- Fixed chests replacing contents in the chest, chests now properly add to the contents
- Fixed chests containing Flying Carpet or Sandstorm In A Bottle having content replaced
- Fixed chests containing Pharaoh's Mask having content replaced
- Fixed Ruin Chest generation and having content replaced
- Fixed Ice Chest generation and having content replaced

Other:
- Fixed silently Caught Exception: Index was outside the bounds of the array.   at Tremor.NPCs.Bosses.CogLord.CogLordProbe.AI()

Code:
- Flags hideCode, hideResources and includeSource are no longer blocking unpacking. Unpack now to get the Tremor.dll
